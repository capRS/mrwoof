* When installing [Mr.Woof](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iR8BdTB3XtaJ2Bp8t3PulWyMJkcNGIIO/view). you might find it say that it is virus. it is not virus. i assure you. the reason it says it is vius is because the app is not in playstore. so google detectes anything outside playstore as unwanted app
* Open Mr.woof app and go through the instructions that pop up
* Congrats now you can spend your time doing other important stuff than watching ads for your 6 alt accounts
